Formed in 1983 by guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine after an acrimonious departure from Metallica, Megadeth became one of the most acclaimed and successful thrash metal bands of their era and beyond. Mustaine expanded on the typical metal blueprint by speeding up the tempos and putting an emphasis on his lightning-fast technical guitar skills. His nihilistic lyrics and unrelenting musical attack resulted in a series of thrash metal classics from Megadeth throughout the 1980s and into the early '90s. Along with being considered high water marks of the metal genre, 1986's Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? and 1992's Countdown to Extinction sold in the millions and influenced the next generation of speed metal bands.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5px" class="text">Throughout Megadeth's many lineup changes, the two core members were bassist Dave Ellefson and guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine (born September 13, 1961), who was the band's official leader. In 1981, Dave Mustaine formed Metallica with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. Mustaine spent two years with Metallica, developing a strong cult following in California's underground metal scene, before he was kicked out of the group in 1983, allegedly over his substance abuse. Immediately following his firing, he formed Megadeth with Ellefson, Slayer guitarist Kerry King, and drummer Lee Rauch. This lineup was extremely short-lived, and Mustaine and Ellefson soon recruited guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5px" class="text">Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?For the next few years, Megadeth toured and gained a following, signing with the independent label Combat in late 1984. The following year, the group released its debut, Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!, which received strong reviews, not only in metal-oriented publications, but also in mainstream music magazines. The album sold very well for an independent release, which attracted the attention of major record labels. By the end of the year, the group had signed with Capitol. Megadeth's first major-label album, Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, was released in the fall of 1986. Like its predecessor, Peace Sells was greeted by strong reviews and sales; it eventually went platinum.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5px" class="text">Rust in PeaceIn the years immediately following the release of So Far, So Good...So What!, Mustaine was impaired by his drug addictions. In early 1990, he was arrested for driving under the influence and entered a rehabilitation program. Metallica broke through to the mainstream in 1991, and sensing the possibility for similar success, Mustaine followed suit in stripping down Megadeth's sound, though it remained as technically perfectionist as Rust in Peace. The result, Countdown to Extinction, was released in 1992, entering the charts at number two; the record went double platinum and became the band's biggest hit, confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5px" class="text">Now one of the most popular metal bands in the world, Megadeth moved further toward the mainstream with Youthanasia in 1994, which entered the charts at number four and, like its predecessor, went platinum. The following year, the group released Hidden Treasures, a rarities collection that featured some of the soundtrack tunes that had helped expand the group's MTV audience in the early '90s. Released in 1997, Cryptic Writings found Megadeth fully embraced by album rock radio, which formerly would never have touched the band. Ex-Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso signed on in 1998, in time for the following year's Risk. In 2000, following the release of the best-of Capitol Punishment, Marty Friedman followed Nick Menza out the door; he was replaced by former Savatage and Alice Cooper guitarist Al Pitrelli. After signing with the BMG subsidiary Sanctuary, Megadeth debuted their new lineup on 2001's The World Needs a Hero.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5px" class="text">In 2018, the band unveiled a deluxe reissue of their debut, Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good! The Final Kill. The set included a remastered edition of the original album; live cuts recorded in England, Germany, and the U.S. between 1986 and 1990; a three-track demo from 1984; and a rare cover, "These Boots." The next year Mustaine hand selected 35 tracks from the band's massive studio discography to be compiled into an anthology/greatest-hits collection entitled Warheads on Foreheads. The epic collection was released in March of 2019</p>
